    * Custom image sizes now an option.

    * Renderer now takes fewer options as perspective matrix isn't used.

    * All steps of the data pipeline are now typed.

    * Removed various options such as predict sigma (we always predict), no-translate (we always translate) and several others to streamline things.

    * Separated out train and test functions into different files to aid organisation.

    * Added the basics of detecting whether or not the model has stopped improving, using the ICP algorithm and numba.

    * Changed the tests a little to reflect the various changes elsewhere in the program.

    * Various minor improvements all over the place.
